Useful scripts (at least for me) for resolving common issues and helping me to improve my productivity

## Description
This project aims to provide a secure box for my shell labs. Here I put some scripts that help me at the work or even at home, such as automating common tasks or simplifying boilerplate calls using wrappers. 

## Usage
Just download the scripts and have some fun.

## Project status
As soon I come with new ideas or needs, I put them into this repository. :-)
